### ✅ Tasks Completed

**Project Setup**
- Initialized Git repository (`git init`)
- Created `.gitignore` (tuned for .NET + Angular)
- Set up Docker Compose for PostgreSQL database
- Created project folder structure (Backend: Clean Architecture 4-layer, Frontend: Angular)
- Created `task_list.md` — full professional task breakdown across 8 phases

**Phase 1 — Domain Layer (fully completed)**
- Defined `Todo` entity with all professional properties (GUID ID, audit fields, soft delete, ownership)
- Defined `User` entity
- Created abstract `Entity<TId>` base class (all entities inherit common fields)
- Defined `Priority` enum (Low / Medium / High)
- Defined `IDomainEvent` interface + `TodoCreatedEvent` domain event
- Defined `IRepository<T>` and `ITodoRepository` interfaces
- Defined custom Domain Exceptions (`TodoNotFoundException`, `UnauthorizedTodoAccessException`)

**Phase 2 — Application Layer (started)**
- Installed `MediatR` NuGet package
- Set up MediatR dependency injection registration in `DependencyInjection.cs`
- Created `IUnitOfWork` and `ICurrentUserService` interfaces
- Implemented `CreateTodoCommand` and `CreateTodoCommandHandler`
- Implemented `UpdateTodoCommand` and `UpdateTodoCommandHandler`
- Implemented `DeleteTodoCommand` and `DeleteTodoCommandHandler`
- Implemented `ToggleTodoCompleteCommand` and `ToggleTodoCompleteCommandHandler`
- Created `IPasswordHasher` and `IJwtTokenService` interfaces
- Implemented `RegisterUserCommand` and `RegisterUserCommandHandler`
- Implemented `LoginUserCommand` and `LoginUserCommandHandler`
- Implemented `GetAllTodosQuery` and `GetAllTodosQueryHandler`
- Implemented `GetTodoByIdQuery` and `GetTodoByIdQueryHandler`
- Implemented `GetTodosPagedQuery` and `GetTodosPagedQueryHandler`
- Added `TodoDto`, `CreateTodoRequest`, `UpdateTodoRequest`, and `ApiResponse<T>`, `PaginatedList<T>` models
- Created `TodoNotFoundException`
- Extended `ITodoRepository` with `GetPagedByUserIdAsync` for paginated queries

### 🧠 Key Decisions & Why
- **GUID over int for IDs**: UUIDs are harder to guess (security), and avoid ID collisions in distributed systems. Industry standard.
- **Soft delete (`IsDeleted` flag)**: Real apps never permanently delete data — regulatory requirements, audit trails, accidental deletion recovery.
- **Clean Architecture (4 layers)**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API. Each layer only knows about the layer below it. This makes the code testable and swappable (e.g., swap SQL Server for PostgreSQL without touching business logic).
- **CQRS with MediatR**: Separates "reading" from "writing" operations. Each use case is its own class — easy to find, test, and modify independently.
- **Repository pattern**: Application layer defines interfaces (`ITodoRepository`), Infrastructure implements them. Application never touches EF Core directly.
- **IUnitOfWork abstraction**: Separated database commit logic (`SaveChangesAsync`) from repository query/add logic. Ensures commands can coordinate multiple changes in one transaction without bleeding EF Core into Application.
- **Authorization in Query**: In `UpdateTodoCommandHandler`, we fetch the Todo using `GetByIdAndUserAsync`. This enforces that users can only update their own items, addressing a key security requirement early in the Application layer.
- **Targeted Updates vs Full Updates**: Created a specific `ToggleTodoCompleteCommand` instead of forcing the frontend to use `UpdateTodoCommand` just to check a box. This is better for performance and intent-driven APIs.
- **Soft Delete in Repository**: `DeleteTodoCommandHandler` calls `_todoRepository.Delete()`. Following our project rules, this will be implemented as a soft delete (`IsDeleted = true`) inside the EF Core Infrastructure layer, keeping the Application layer completely agnostic of how deletion is stored.
- **Authentication Abstractions**: We defined `IPasswordHasher` and `IJwtTokenService` in the Application layer, but we DO NOT implement them here. The actual implementation (BCrypt, JWT Bearer) requires external libraries, which belongs in Infrastructure. This strictly enforces the Dependency Rule of Clean Architecture.
- **Domain Exceptions for Auth**: Created `EmailAlreadyInUseException` and `InvalidCredentialsException`. By using typed exceptions instead of generic ones or returning nulls, the API layer (Phase 4) can easily map these to HTTP 409 Conflict and HTTP 401 Unauthorized via global middleware.
- **Custom exceptions for missing data**: Created `TodoNotFoundException` instead of returning null or generic exceptions. This makes the code expressive and allows the API layer to map this to HTTP 404 globally.
- **Dedicated Response Wrappers**: Implemented `PaginatedList<T>` and `ApiResponse<T>` to encapsulate responses along with metadata (Success flag, TotalCount, TotalPages, Errors) to give the frontend all the data it needs for UI controls consistently across the API.
- **Repository-level Pagination**: Decided to add `GetPagedByUserIdAsync` to `ITodoRepository`. Filtering, sorting, and pagination must be handled in the database query (via the repository) rather than loading all items into application memory.
- **Separate Request DTOs**: Created `CreateTodoRequest` and `UpdateTodoRequest` instead of reusing MediatR commands as API payloads. This ensures the API payload contracts are decoupled from internal Application logic.
